> Multiple processes accessing a shared resource concurrently

## Overview

This example starts a shared database and multiple processes.

In this project, we'll look at what happens with concurrent processes are accessing a shared resource.  A shared resource could be a SQLite database, a queue (first-in, first-out, like a grocery store line), a deque ("deck") if working with sliding time windows (which we'll do later), an office printer, or more. 



## Prerequisites

1. Git
1. Python 3.7+ (3.11+ preferred)
1. VS Code Editor
1. VS Code Extension: Python (by Microsoft)

## Task 1. Fork 

Fork this repository ("repo") into **your** GitHub account. 

## Task 2. Clone

Clone **your** new GitHub repo down to the Documents folder on your local machine. 

## Task 3. Explore

Explore your new project repo in VS Code on your local machine.

## Task 4. Execute Check Script

Execute 00_check_core.py to generate useful information.

## Task 5. Execute Multiple Processes Project Script

Execute multiple_processes.py.

In this first run, we start 3 processes, 
each inserting 2 records into a shared database 
(for a total of 6 records inserted.)

In each case, the process gets a connection to the database, 
and a cursor to execute SQL statements.
It inserts a record, and exits the database quickly.

In general, we're successful and six new records get inserted. 

## Task 6. Execute Multiple Processes Script with Longer Tasks

For the second run, modify the task duration to make each task take 3 seconds. 
Hint: Look for the TODO.
Run the script again. 
With the longer tasks, we now get into trouble - 
one process will have the database open and be working on it - 
then when another process tries to do the same, it can't and 
we end up with errors. 

## Task 7. Document Results After Each Run

To clear the terminal, in the terminal window, type clear and hit enter or return. 

`clear`

To document results, clear the terminal, run the script, and paste all of the terminal contents into the output file.

Use out0.txt to document the first run. 

Use out3.txt to document the second run.

### Reading Error Messages

Python has pretty helpful error messages. 
When you get an error, read them carefully. 

- What error do you get?

### Database Is Locked Error

Do a web search on the sqlite3 'database is locked' error.

- What do you learn?
- Once a process fails, it crashes the main process and everything stops. 

### Deadlock

Deadlock is a special kind of locking issue where a process 
is waiting on a resource or process, that is waiting also. 

Rather than crashing, a system in deadlock may wait indefinitely, 
with no process able to move forward and make progress.
